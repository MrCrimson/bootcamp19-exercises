In our app, we decided on having three major components: a task list, a search bar, and an add bar. When the user has not added anything to the list, the task list will say that there is nothing to be done. The functionality of the add bar will be in the similar fashion to a form, where we add whatever was typed by the user into an array containing tasks to be completed. Each task within the task list also has a delete or done button to remove it from the list. To remove the task from the list, we plan to create a boolean attributed to each task showing whether the task has been completed. To display the correct tasks, we would filter tasks from a larger array consisting of all tasks added into a list of uncompleted tasks. To search for a todo, we would first check that a task has not been completed yet via the boolean, then we would filter the array of completed tasks based on whether a task contains the input to the search bar as a substring. Thus, this filtered array is then displayed on the task list. Otherwise, if the filtered array is empty, we would say that no seach results were found.
